# Dungeon-Panic
This game was a project made for school. The assignment was to make a highscore game in Processing in a team with only movement inputs and two inputs of choice. My team mates were Koen Groot, Casper Klinkhamer, Leander Grinsven and Mike Breur.
My contribution to this project was the highscore class in which i got to learn how to use hashmaps.
This git project only shows the scripts as there are too many files to upload the entire project.
